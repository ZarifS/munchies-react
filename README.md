# munchies-react
The munchies app front end repo. Relies on munchies-python for api and data retrieval.

The application was developed by myself and Pasoon Azimi for our Database course. Given a set of requirements for a database we were instructed to create a front end that would query data from the database and show the user. Although a robust front end was not required it was a great way for me to learn React development so we decided to build this.
